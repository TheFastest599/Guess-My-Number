# Guess My Number Game

## Introduction

"Guess My Number" is a simple and fun game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates a random number between 1 and 20, and the player's goal is to guess that number.

## How to Play

1. The game starts with a random number between 1 and 20.
2. Enter your guess in the input field and click the "Check!" button.
3. If your guess is too high or too low, the game will give you a hint.
